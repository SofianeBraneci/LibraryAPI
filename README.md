# Library API

As the name suggests, this API manages a Library, the actual books are stored in a MongoDB instance on MongoDB Atlas.

The API itself is built using ExpressJs since there was no specified framework to use and for the database access I've used the native mongodb driver. Each book look like the following json document

```json
{
      "id": 46,
      "title": "A Christmas Carol in Prose; Being a Ghost Story of Christmas",
      "authors": [
        {
          "name": "Dickens, Charles",
          "birth_year": 1812,
          "death_year": 1870
        }
      ],
      "translators": [],
      "subjects": [
        "Christmas stories",
        "Ghost stories",
        "London (England) -- Fiction",
        "Misers -- Fiction",
        "Poor families -- Fiction",
        "Scrooge, Ebenezer (Fictitious character) -- Fiction",
        "Sick children -- Fiction"
      ],
      "bookshelves": [
        "Children's Literature",
        "Christmas"
      ],
      "languages": [
        "en"
      ],
      "copyright": false,
      "media_type": "Text",
      "formats": {
        "application/epub+zip": "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46.epub.images",
        "application/rdf+xml": "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46.rdf",
        "application/x-mobipocket-ebook": "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46.kindle.images",
        "text/plain; charset=us-ascii": "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/46/46-0.txt",
        "text/plain": "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46.txt.utf-8",
        "image/jpeg": "https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/46/pg46.cover.small.jpg",
        "text/html": "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/46/46-h/46-h.htm",
        "application/zip": "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/46/46-0.zip"
      },
      "download_count": 68486
    }
```

## API URLs

The current API handles only GET requests, the end points are the following
> http://localhost:3000/library/books

Retrieves all the books from the database. It can also perform pagination if the request contains the parameter *page*, limited amount of the books, with size *pageSize* which is a defined constant.

## Futur Improvments
- Book recommandation
- Search for a book in a specific language
- Search for book that were writen in some range of years
- Improve performance and reponse time (Indexing in mongodb)

### Note: the mongodb instance will be turned off soon, for security purposes
